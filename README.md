# truth-table-generator

The site first prompts the user to input the capital letters they would like to use as variables in their logical expressions. 
When ready, they can hit continue and a starting table will be generated.
They are then able to input logical expressions, and the site will add them to the truth table.
It is currently hosted [here](https://Truth-Table-Generator.vincentedwards1.repl.co) via [replit.com](https://replit.com/).
